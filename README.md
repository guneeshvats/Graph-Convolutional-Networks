# ðŸš€ Graph Convolutional Networks

A PyTorch implementation of **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)** based on the work by Kipf and Welling [[1]](#1). This repository offers a hands-on notebook and dataset to get you started with GCNs quickly and easily.
The implementation also follows an application based example.

## âš¡ Quick Start

1. Open the interactive notebook directly on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/willtryagain/smail-gcn/blob/main/SMAIL.ipynb) for seamless execution.
2. Upload all files from the **Datasets** directory into the Colab session and start experimenting with GCNs.
